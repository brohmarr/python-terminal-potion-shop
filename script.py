# Project: Python CLI Potion Shop
# by: @Brohmarr

# Welcome! You should now be equipped with everything you need to make a
#     complicated program that uses multiple classes that interact with
#     each other. This is where we turn the creativity over to you.
# 
# For this project, we want you to create a fully functional system that
#     involves multiple classes. We’ll give more details on the specific
#     requirements below.
# 
# We know that it can sometimes be hard to come up with an idea on your
#     own. Take some time to think of what you want to create — it truly
#     can be anything. This step is important! We want you to feel
#     motivated to complete this project, so pick something you’re
#     excited to make.

# Requirements:
# 
# [ ] (1) You must create at least TWO classes;
# [ ] (2) Each of those classes must have at least THREE attributes and
#             THREE methods;
# [ ] (3) Your classes should be able to describe themselves (through a
#             __repr__() method);
# [ ] (4) Test all of the methods you created on at least TWO instances
#             of every one of your classes;
# [ ] (5) Create some methods, or additional attributes, that make your
#             two Classes able to interact with each other.
